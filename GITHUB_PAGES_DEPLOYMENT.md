# GitHub Pages Deployment Guide

## Summary of Changes

To make your Next.js site compatible with GitHub Pages, the following changes have been made:

1. **Static Export Configuration**: Updated `next.config.ts` to enable static export
2. **Removed Authentication**: Removed NextAuth and related code that requires a server
3. **Removed Database Dependencies**: Removed Prisma and database-related code
4. **GitHub Actions Workflow**: Created `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` for automated deployment
5. **Updated Documentation**: Modified README.md with deployment instructions

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Commit and Push Changes

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Configure for GitHub Pages deployment"
git push origin main
```

### 2. Configure GitHub Pages

1. Go to your repository settings on GitHub
2. Navigate to "Pages" in the sidebar
3. Under "Build and deployment":
   - Select "GitHub Actions" as the source
4. Save the settings

### 3. Wait for Deployment

After pushing your changes:
1. Go to the "Actions" tab in your repository
2. Wait for the "Deploy to GitHub Pages" workflow to complete successfully
3. Your site will be available at `https://your-username.github.io/mysite/`

## Important Notes

### Features That Won't Work

Since GitHub Pages only serves static files, the following features have been removed:
- User authentication (sign in/sign up)
- Database operations (contact form submissions, user accounts)
- Server-side rendering features

### Alternative Solutions

If you need full authentication and database features, consider:
- **Vercel**: Optimal for Next.js applications with serverless functions
- **Netlify**: Great for static sites with form handling and serverless functions
- **Render**: Good for full-stack applications with database support

## Troubleshooting

### Site Not Appearing

1. Check that the GitHub Actions workflow completed successfully
2. Verify GitHub Pages is configured to deploy from GitHub Actions
3. Ensure your repository is public (required for GitHub Pages)
4. Check the browser console for any errors
5. Make sure you're accessing the correct URL

### Broken Links or Styles

1. Check that all paths are relative (don't start with `/` unless necessary)
2. Verify that the `basePath` in `next.config.ts` matches your repository name if needed
3. Ensure all images and assets are properly referenced

## Future Development

### Adding Features Back

If you want to add authentication or database features back:

1. **For Authentication**: 
   - Consider using a third-party service like Firebase Auth
   - Implement client-side authentication that works with static sites

2. **For Database Features**:
   - Use a backend-as-a-service like Firebase, Supabase, or similar
   - Implement API calls to external services for contact forms

### Local Development

For local development with database features:

1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env`
2. Fill in your database connection details
3. Uncomment database-related code (if you have backups)
4. Run `npm run dev` to start the development server
