# Authentication Plan for GitHub Pages Deployment

## Current Authentication Issues

The site currently uses NextAuth with Prisma for authentication, which requires:
1. Server-side processing
2. Database connectivity (PostgreSQL)
3. API routes for authentication endpoints

These features are not compatible with GitHub Pages, which only serves static files.

## Solution Options

### Option 1: Remove Authentication Features (Recommended for GitHub Pages)

For a static site on GitHub Pages, remove or comment out authentication-related code:

1. In `src/app/page.tsx`, remove or comment out:
   - `import { useSession, signOut } from 'next-auth/react'`
   - `const { data: session } = useSession();`
   - The sign-in/sign-out buttons and conditional rendering

2. Remove authentication-related dependencies from `package.json`:
   - `next-auth`
   - `@auth/prisma-adapter`
   - `bcrypt`

3. Remove authentication-related directories:
   - `src/app/api/auth/`
   - `src/app/auth/`

### Option 2: Use Client-Side Authentication

Replace NextAuth with a client-side authentication solution:

1. Use Firebase Authentication or similar service
2. Implement authentication logic in client components
3. Store user data in browser storage or a cloud database

### Option 3: Create a Static Version

Create a simplified version of the site without authentication:

1. Remove all authentication-related UI elements
2. Create static versions of pages that were behind authentication
3. Implement contact forms with static form handlers (like Formspree or Netlify Forms)

## Recommended Approach for GitHub Pages

For deployment to GitHub Pages, I recommend Option 1 (removing authentication features) because:

1. **Simplicity**: Easiest to implement and maintain
2. **Compatibility**: Fully compatible with static hosting
3. **Performance**: Smaller bundle size and faster loading
4. **Reliability**: No server-side dependencies or potential points of failure

## Implementation Steps

1. Modify `src/app/page.tsx` to remove authentication code
2. Update navigation to remove auth-related links
3. Simplify the contact form to work with static form handlers
4. Update the README with deployment instructions

## Alternative Recommendation

If you need full authentication and database features, consider deploying to:
- Vercel (optimal for Next.js)
- Netlify
- Render
- Railway

These platforms support server-side rendering and database connectivity.
