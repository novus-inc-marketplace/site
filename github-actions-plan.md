# GitHub Actions Workflow Plan

## Directory Structure

We need to create the following directory and file:
```
.mysite/
└── .github/
    └── workflows/
        └── deploy.yml
```

## Workflow Configuration

The `deploy.yml` file should contain:

```yaml
name: Deploy to GitHub Pages

on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
  workflow_dispatch:

permissions:
  contents: read
  pages: write
  id-token: write

concurrency:
  group: "pages"
  cancel-in-progress: false

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Setup Node
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: "20"
          cache: "npm"

      - name: Setup Pages
        uses: actions/configure-pages@v3

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm ci

      - name: Build with Next.js
        run: npx next build

      - name: Upload artifact
        uses: actions/upload-pages-artifact@v3
        with:
          path: ./out

  deploy:
    environment:
      name: github-pages
      url: ${{ steps.deployment.outputs.page_url }}
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    needs: build
    steps:
      - name: Deploy to GitHub Pages
        id: deployment
        uses: actions/deploy-pages@v3
```

## Implementation Steps

1. Create the `.github/workflows` directory structure
2. Create the `deploy.yml` file with the above content
3. Commit and push the changes to trigger the workflow
4. Enable GitHub Pages in the repository settings to deploy from GitHub Actions

## Important Notes

- This workflow assumes the Next.js app is in the root directory
- The workflow will automatically build and deploy on every push to the main branch
- The built static files will be placed in the `./out` directory
- GitHub Pages needs to be configured to deploy from GitHub Actions in the repository settings
